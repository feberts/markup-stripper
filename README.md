# Markup stripper

I use this tool to remove markup elements from LaTeX and Markdown text for more reliable spellchecking. Spell checkers are sometimes confused by too much markup; latex macros can even hide grammar errors that would otherwise be detected.

This is **not** a universal tool. I built this for myself and only put it here to have it hosted by github pages. If you find it useful nonetheless, you can add new entries to the replacement functions. This tool is particularly useful if a browser plug-in for spellchecking is installed.
