# Markup stripper

I use this tool to remove markup elements such as text decorations and macros from LaTeX and Markdown text for the purpose of more reliable spellchecking. Spell checkers are sometimes confused by too much markup; latex macros can even hide some grammar errors, that the spell checker would otherwise recognize.

This is **not** a universal tool. I built this mainly to remove my own latex macros, and I only put it here to have it hosted by github pages. If you find this useful anyway, then you need to add new entries to the replacement functions.

This tool is particularly useful if a browser plug-in for spellchecking is installed.
